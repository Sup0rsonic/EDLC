## FAQ  
> How this works?  
> By reading your game logs, the program provides you a totally not realistic cockpit cat meowing feedback of limpets.  
> How do you implement it? Was there any cat hurt in the process?   
> We throws a cat into your limpet controller. As long as your ship remains intact, it will be safe.  
> How can I run it?  
> Start the file before the game start or after the game start, as long as the game and the program is up and running, it will work.
