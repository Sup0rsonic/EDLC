- README.TXT    --  The declaration the [type of the limpet], cat type, cat name, cat age, cat color, and its living habits, if possible.  
- ACTION_[LIMPET_ACTION].mp3 or ACTION_[LIMPET_ACTION].wav, e.g. ACTION_DEPLOY.mp3  
The sound played when the limpet is at the designated state. The sound should comes from a cat, a.k.a. Felix Catus, or other creatures from Felis species. The sound needs to be edited so the sfx can be added to it without hearable loss, or inconvinience.  
- PICTURE_[PICTURE].[PICTURE FORMAT]
